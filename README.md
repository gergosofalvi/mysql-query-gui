# Database Administration Web Application

This web application provides an intuitive interface for database administration tasks. It allows users to manage SQL queries dynamically, making it easy to add, edit, and execute queries on the database. The application also incorporates user management features, enhancing security and access control.

## Features
- Dynamic Query Management: Easily add, modify, and remove SQL queries in the system using the "elements.js" file.
- User Management: Administrators can manage user accounts, ensuring secure access to the application.
- Confirmation Popup: Before executing any query, users are prompted with a confirmation popup to prevent accidental operations.
- Dark Mode: A dark mode option is available for users who prefer a darker theme.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Ensure you have a working database connection and configure it in the application settings.
4. Add your SQL queries, descriptions, and labels in the "elements.js" file as needed.
